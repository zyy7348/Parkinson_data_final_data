This is an R Markdown document for homework 1!

## Problem 1

```{r code}
vec1 = c(1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0)
vec1 * 5
vec1 + 7
vec2 = 1:10
vec1 + vec2
vec1 * vec2
```

* When involving a vector and a scalar or two vectors, R can do arithmetic operations (e.g. multiply). However, the longer object length should be the mutiple of the shorter. Thus, we can not add vectors of length ten and length nine, but can add vectors of length ten and length five. And when adding length five to length ten, the former would add again from the sixth to the tenth number in the length of ten to get the result.

## Problem 2

```{r code_random_sample}
samp = runif(10000, min = 0, max = 10)
samp_remov = samp[samp <= 9.4] 
```

* The length of the vector is `r length(samp_remov)`.
* The mean of the vector is `r mean(samp_remov)`.
* The median of the vector is `r median(samp_remov)`.
* The standard deviation of the vector is `r sd(samp_remov)`.
* The minumum value of the vector is `r min(samp_remov)`.
* The maximum value of the vector is `r max(samp_remov)`.

```{r code_random_sample_new}
samp = rnorm(5000, mean = 5, sd = 5)
samp_remov = samp[samp >= 0] 
hist(samp_remov)
```

* In this section, we created two samples. 
* In the first chunk, we removed values from the first sample that are greater than 9.4 and then Wrote descriptions(length, mean and median, standard deviation, minumum and maximum) of it using inline R code. 
* In the second chunk, we created another sample and omitted values that are less than zero and then made a histogram of the new sample.

## Problem 3

```{r code_problem3}
vec1 = 1:5
vec2 = c("How", "old", "are", "you", "?")
vec_combine = c(vec1, vec2)
class(vec_combine)
vec3 = c("a", 7, 42)
l = list(a = "a",
         b = 7,
         c = 42)
l$b + l$c
```

* Created a vector containing five integers and vector containing five character strings. We cannot add two vectors above.
* Combined the two vectors into one using c(), and the class of the new vector is character.
* Created a vector containing the values "a", 7, and 42. We cannot add the second and third values of this vector because computer recognizes them as characters, not numbers.
* Created a list containing the values "a", 7, and 42. We can add the second and third values of this list because they are in the list, not in a vector, list can contains different types of values, now 7 and 42 are all numeric.
